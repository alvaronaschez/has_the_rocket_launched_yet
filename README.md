# Has The Rocket Launched Yet
A very simple telegram bot written in python using [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) framework.

The problem is simple:  
We have a video of a rocket launch and we want to know at which frame exactly is the rocket launched.  
You and the bot will work together to find it!  

so... **Divide and Conquer!**
